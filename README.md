Rapid Prototyping in Museum Office Culture

At the Cooper-Hewitt Labs we are trying to keep ourselves as nimble as possible. We often work on "one day projects" which allow us to wash away the day-to-day office work and focus on a single feature addition or concept. Oftentimes these days lead to some of our favorite site features. Examples of this include our addition of a QR code for every collection record, an SMS and voice system that ties into our collections API, a responsive footer design, search by color, and much, much more. In this talk I will cover a few more examples and talk about the importance of "shipping code." I'll explain a few ideas for doing rapid prototyping in a museum context and discuss how participants might build this into their institutional workflows.
